# Finetuning Llama2 for Personalized College Chatbot

This repository demonstrates how to finetune the Llama2 model from Hugging Face to create a personalized chatbot for a college environment. The model is finetuned on a dataset containing two columns: `query` and `response`. This finetuned model can then be used to interact with students, answering queries related to college services, courses, events, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Account (to use pre-trained models and push your fine-tuned model)
- Hugging Face `transformers` and `datasets` libraries
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (PyTorch is recommended for this project)
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)
- pip (for installing dependencies)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finetune-llama2-college-chatbot.git
cd finetune-llama2-college-chatbot
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hugging Face Setup

You need to set up your Hugging Face account and get your API token.

1. Sign up/log in at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).
2. Go to [Settings â†’ Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a new token with the necessary permissions.
3. Add the token to your environment variables for secure use:

```bash
export HF_USERNAME="your_huggingface_username"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_write_token"
```

## Dataset

Prepare your dataset in a CSV or JSONL format with two columns:

- `query`: The input queries students might ask.
- `response`: The chatbot's response to each query.

Example format for `train.csv`:

| query                          | response                           |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| What are the college admission requirements? | The admission requirements are... |
| What events are happening this semester? | This semester, we have...         |

Ensure your file is placed under the `data/` directory in the project.

## Finetuning the Model

This section explains how to finetune the Llama2 model locally.

### Step 1: Setup Training Parameters

You can modify the `params.py` to adjust training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc. Here's an example of the parameters for training:

```python
from autotrain.params import LLMTrainingParams
from autotrain.project import AutoTrainProject

HF_USERNAME = "your_huggingface_username"
HF_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_write_token"  # Get it from https://huggingface.co/settings/token

params = LLMTrainingParams(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",  # Llama-2 base model from Hugging Face
    data_path="data/",  # Path to the dataset (CSV/JSONL)
    chat_template="tokenizer",  # Using chat template defined in the model's tokenizer
    text_column="query",  # The column in your dataset with user queries
    response_column="response",  # The column in your dataset with model responses
    train_split="train",  # Training data split name
    trainer="sft",  # Choose from sft, default, orpo, dpo, and reward
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=2,  # Adjust depending on your GPU memory
    lr=1e-5,
    peft=True,  # Training LoRA using PEFT
    quantization="int4",  # Using int4 quantization for reduced model size
    target_modules="all-linear",  # Focus on training all linear modules
    padding="right",
    optimizer="paged_adamw_8bit",
    scheduler="cosine",
    gradient_accumulation=8,
    mixed_precision="bf16",
    merge_adapter=True,
    project_name="college-chatbot-llama2",  # Name your project
    log="tensorboard",
    push_to_hub=True,  # Push model to Hugging Face Hub after training
    username=HF_USERNAME,
    token=HF_TOKEN,
)

project = AutoTrainProject(params=params, backend="local", process=True)
project.create()
```

### Step 2: Start the Training

Once your parameters are configured, you can start the training process by running the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Step 3: Monitoring Training

You can monitor the training using TensorBoard. To do this, run:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```

This will provide real-time feedback on the loss and other metrics during the training.

### Step 4: Push the Model to Hugging Face

After finetuning is complete, you can push the model to Hugging Face Hub for easy access and deployment:

```bash
python push_to_hub.py
```

This will upload the trained model to your Hugging Face account.

## Usage

Once the model is finetuned, you can load it and use it to interact with the chatbot. Here's an example of how to use the model for chatbot interaction:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your_huggingface_username/college-chatbot-llama2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

def get_response(query):
    inputs = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

query = "What is the last date for submitting assignments?"
response = get_response(query)
print(response)
```
